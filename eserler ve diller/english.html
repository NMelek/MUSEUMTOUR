        <p>The dagger, made by Sultan Mahmud I in 1740 as a gift to Nadir Shah of the Afshar Dynasty of Iran, was returned after Nadir Shah was killed in a rebellion, and the Ottoman ambassador who set out to deliver the gift was placed in the treasury of Topkapi Palace.

            The hilt of the 35-centimeter dagger is decorated with 3 very valuable large emeralds, and its scabbard is decorated with diamonds of different sizes. In the middle of the scabbard is an enamel miniature with a fruit basket pattern, and on its hilt is a small clock, rarely produced in London at the time.
            
            The dagger, which was first exhibited abroad in the United States, is considered one of the treasures representing the power of the Ottoman Empire. You can learn more by listening and reading.</p> <!-- Informational text -->
